            The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.
            With a line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison
            and Ringo Starr, they are regarded as the most influential band of
            all time. The group were integral to the evolution of pop music
            into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of
            the 1960s. Their sound, rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock
            and roll, incorporated elements of classical music and traditional
            pop in innovative ways. They also pioneered recording techniques
            and explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to
            psychedelia and hard rock. As they continued to draw influences
            from a variety of cultural sources, their musical and lyrical
            sophistication grew, and they came to be seen as embodying the
            era's socio-cultural movements.

            Led by the band's primary songwriters, Lennon and McCartney, the
            Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg
            over a three-year period from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass.
            The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had been together
            since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best,
            before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein
            moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin
            guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their
            domestic success after their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962.
            As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed "Beatlemania",
            the band acquired the nickname "the Fab Four", with Epstein, Martin
            and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the
            informal title of "fifth Beatle".

            The Beatles were international stars by early 1964, leading the
            "British Invasion" of the United States pop market and breaking
            numerous sales records. They soon made their film debut with A
            Hard Day's Night (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced increasingly
            innovative recordings, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965),
            Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967),
            and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also
            known as the "White Album", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). In 1968,
            they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that
            continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After
            the group's break-up in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as
            solo artists. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and
            Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr
            remain musically active.

            The Beatles are the best-selling band in history, with estimated
            sales of over 800 million albums worldwide. They are the best-selling
            music artists in the US, with certified sales of over 178 million
            units, and have had more number-one albums on the British charts,
            and have sold more singles in the UK, than any other act. The group
            were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all
            four main members were inducted individually between 1994 and 2015.
            In 2008, the group topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time
            most successful artists; as of 2019, the Beatles hold the record
            for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with twenty. The band
            have received seven Grammy Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original
            Song Score for the 1970 film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello
            Awards. They were also collectively included in Time magazine's
            compilation of the twentieth century's 100 most influential people.
